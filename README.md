This repository contains bare-metal programming projects for the STM32F4 microcontroller family. Each project is implemented without relying on HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) or other high-level libraries, providing a deeper understanding of:

ARM Cortex-M4 architecture

STM32F4xx peripherals (GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, Timers, ADC, etc.)

Register-level programming for efficient hardware control

Sensor and component interfacing (e.g., LEDs, buttons, LCDs, motors, IMUs, environmental sensors)

ðŸ”„ Frequently Updated
New projects are added regularly, covering different peripherals and external components to help developers master STM32 programming from the ground up.
